# Harp
----------------

Harp is an open source Asset Pipeline Framework (aka Static Site Generator) for rapidly building responsive HTML5 applications. What makes Harp unique is that it has a Platform built from the ground up for hosting Harp applications (through Dropbox no less). See [harp.io](http://harp.io) for more details.

What is an Asset Pipeline Framework you ask? An Asset Pipeline Framework offers the best tradeoffs between Static Site Generator (such as Jekyll) and a Full Stack Framework such as (Ruby on Rails). It compiles to static assets but has some runtime functionality that SSGs typically don't have (such as redirects and auth). The asset pipeline is fist-class requiring no configuration to get started.

### Features

  - **asset pipeline** - built-in asset pipeline for seamlessly serving of [jade](http://jade-lang.com/) and [less](http://lesscss.org/) files.
  - **layouts and partials** - the beloved layout/partial templating paradigm you know and love.
  - **global variables** - specify global variables to be available in all your templates.
  - **selected state** - a `current` object is available in all your templates for determining the current page.
  - **traverse filesystem** - iterate over your filesystem to easily generate things like an html5 cache manifest file.
  - **asset ordering** - easy to list the order your assets are referenced.
  - **server** - harp ships with a built-in server (great for development).

### Installation

    npm install -g harp

<a name="quickstart"/>
### Quick Start

Creating a new harp application is a breeze...

    mkdir myproj; cd myproj
    harp init

Now lets spin up the server and view the project at http://localhost:9966

    harp server

## The Rules

Rather than offering a complex feature set, harp has simple rules on how it works. Harp is a katana, not a swiss army knife. By understanding the rules, one will know how to effectively use harp.

<a name="rules-1"/>
### 1) Convention over Configuration.

Harp will function with as little as a `public/index.html` file and doesn't require any configuration to get going. To add more routes just add more files. All harp's features are based off conventions that you will discover by learning the rest of these rules. Harp is about offering a sane development framework which follows established best practices. Harp is not designed to be everything to everyone, but what it does, it does perfectly.

**Design Rationale:** By using convention over configuration, harp is easier to learn, which makes you more productive. 

**Anatomy of a typical harp application:**

    myapp.harp.io/                    <-- root of your application (assets in the root not served)
      |- harp.json                    <-- configuration, globals goes here.
      +- public/                      <-- your application assets belong in the public dir
          |- _layout.jade             <-- optional layout file
          |- index.jade               <-- must have an index.html or index.jade file
          |- _shared/                 <-- arbitrary directory for shared partials
          |   +- nav.jade             <-- a partial for navigation
          +- articles/                <-- pages in here will have "/articles/" in URL (old school style)
              |- _data.json           <-- articles metadata goes here
              +- hello-world.jade     <-- must have an index.html or index.jade file

<a name="rules-2"/>
### 2) Public Directory is public.

Your `public` directory is required to have a functioning harp application. It defines what will be served publicly and what URLs your application exposes. Public assets belong in the `public` directory and assets outside of the `public` directory will not be served.

    myapp.harp.io/
      |- README.md                    <--- won't be served
      |- secrets.txt                  <--- won't be served
      +- public/                      <--- required public directory
          +- index.html               <--- will be served

<a name="rules-3"/>
### 3) Ignore those which start with underscore.

Any files or directories that begin with underscore will be ignored by the server. This is the recommended naming convention for `layout` and `partial` files. Harp will honour this rule for both files and directories.

**Design Rationale:** By having a simple convention. It is easy to specify and identify which assets will not be served to the end user.

**Example:**

    myapp.harp.io/
      +- public/
          |- index.html               <--- will be served
          |- _some-partial.jade       <--- won't be served
          +- _shared-partials/        <--- won't be served
              +- nav.jade

<a name="rules-4"/>
### 4) Dead simple asset pipeline.

Both `jade` and `less` are built into harp. Just add an extension of `.jade` or `.less` to your file and harp's asset pipeline will do the rest.

Harp knows how to handle jade and less files as html and css respectively. Just add the file, and reference its counterpart.
    
    myfile.jade             ->        myfile.html
    myfile.less             ->        myfile.css

If you like, you may specify which mime type the file will be served with by prefixing the extension with the desired extension.

    myfile.jade             ->        myfile.html
    myfile.xml.jade         ->        myfile.xml

...but this is optional as every extension has a default output extension. The following is the same as above...

    myfile.less             ->        myfile.css
    myfile.css.less         ->        myfile.css

<a name="rules-5"/>
### 5) Flexible metadata

You Files named `_data.json` are special and make data available to templates.

    myapp.harp.io/
      +- public/
          |- index.jade
          +- articles/
              |- _data.json           <-- articles metadata goes here
              |- hello-world.jade     <-- hello world article
              +- hello-brazil.jade    <-- hello brazil article
              
Your `_data.json` file may look contain the following...

    {                                                       <-- avaliable to all templates as globals.public.articles.data
      "hello-world": {                                      <-- because this matches the filename, these variables will be
        "title": "Hello World. My very first Article.",         made available in the hello-world.jade template when being
        "date": "Feb 28, 2013"                                  served. This object is also available in all the templates
      },                                                        as globals.public.articles.data.hello-world.
      "hello-brazil": {
        "title": "Hello Brazil. I like Brazil too.",
        "date": "March 4, 2013"
      }
    }

In our templates we may iterate over the articles with the following in your jade file...

    for article, slug in globals.public.articles.data
      a(href="/articles/#{ slug }")
        h2= article.title
